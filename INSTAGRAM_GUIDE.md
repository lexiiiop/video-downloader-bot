# Instagram Video Download Guide

## 🎉 New Feature: Instagram Video Downloads

Your video downloader now supports **Instagram video downloads** using the powerful **Instaloader** library!

## ✨ What's New

- **Instagram-specific download engine** using Instaloader
- **Better authentication** with Instagram sessions
- **Improved success rate** for Instagram videos
- **Automatic platform detection** - Instagram URLs are automatically routed to the best download method

## 🔗 Supported Instagram URL Formats

- `https://www.instagram.com/p/SHORTCODE/` (Posts)
- `https://www.instagram.com/reel/SHORTCODE/` (Reels)
- `https://www.instagram.com/tv/SHORTCODE/` (IGTV)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Method 1: Simple Download (Public Content)
1. Copy any Instagram video URL
2. Paste it into the downloader
3. Select your preferred format
4. Click "Download Video"

### Method 2: Authenticated Download (Private Content)
For better success rates and access to private content:

1. **Create Instagram Session** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # Using curl
   curl -X POST https://your-backend-url/api/instagram/session \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username": "your_instagram_username", "password": "your_instagram_password"}'
   ```

2. **Or use the frontend** (if session creation UI is added)

## 🔐 Authentication Benefits

Creating an Instagram session provides:
- ✅ **Higher success rate** for downloads
- ✅ **Access to private content** (if you follow the account)
- ✅ **Reduced rate limiting**
- ✅ **Better video quality**

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Backend Changes
- **Instaloader 5.1.1** added to requirements
- **Platform detection** automatically routes Instagram URLs
- **Session management** for authenticated downloads
- **Progress tracking** for Instagram downloads

### How It Works
1. **URL Analysis**: System detects Instagram URLs automatically
2. **Post ID Extraction**: Extracts the unique post identifier
3. **Authentication**: Uses saved session if available
4. **Video Download**: Downloads the highest quality video available
5. **File Management**: Saves with proper naming and auto-cleanup

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Could not extract Instagram post ID"**
- Make sure the URL is a valid Instagram post/reel/IGTV URL
- Check that the URL is complete and not truncated

**"This Instagram post does not contain a video"**
- The post might be an image, not a video
- Try a different Instagram post

**"Instagram error: Login required"**
- Create an Instagram session using the authentication endpoint
- Or try downloading public content without authentication

**"Rate limited"**
- Wait a few minutes before trying again
- Use authenticated sessions to reduce rate limiting

### Best Practices

1. **Use authenticated sessions** for better reliability
2. **Respect Instagram's terms of service**
3. **Don't download content you don't have permission to access**
4. **Use for personal use only**

## 📱 Testing

Try these test URLs:
- Public Instagram posts with videos
- Instagram Reels
- IGTV videos

## 🔄 Migration from yt-dlp

The system now automatically:
- **Detects Instagram URLs** and routes them to Instaloader
- **Uses yt-dlp for other platforms** (YouTube, etc.)
- **Maintains all existing functionality** for non-Instagram content

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test with your Instagram URLs**
2. **Create an Instagram session** for better results
3. **Report any issues** you encounter
4. **Enjoy faster, more reliable Instagram downloads!**
